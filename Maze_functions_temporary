1.
// a function or functions that returns whether each direction from a node is a wall, being explored by an avatar, has a connection or is unknown.

2.
// a function or functions that allow you to change the state of a direction, e.g. from being unknown to having a connection
//  OPTIONAL:
//  if a state is updated from unknown to wall, then fill in the connections that must exist given this new wall. 
//  (This should not be too hard, however finish the other functions first before implementing this so we can get the algorithm
//     up and running first)
//
// if a state is updated from unknown to having a connection, then fill in the walls that must exist given this new path. 
//           (This is the one that involves searching for cycles within the tree, only do this if you have enough time)

3.
// a function that deletes the maze structure

4.
// a function that initializes the maze structure given the width and height, with border walls filled in
